# Issue Triage

Review all open issues and improve their quality for implementation-readiness.

## Environment Check
!`gh auth status 2>&1 | head -3`

## Open Issues
!`gh issue list --state open --limit 50 --json number,title,labels,updatedAt -q '.[] | "#\(.number): \(.title) [\(.labels | map(.name) | join(", "))] (updated: \(.updatedAt | split("T")[0]))"'`

## Issues with "ready" label (already triaged)
!`gh issue list --label "ready" --state open --limit 20 --json number -q '.[].number' | tr '\n' ',' | sed 's/,$//'`

## Recent agent comments (avoid re-commenting)
!`gh api repos/:owner/:repo/issues/comments --jq '[.[] | select(.user.login | contains("bot") or contains("agent")) | .issue_url | split("/") | last] | unique | join(",")' 2>/dev/null | head -1 || echo "Unable to fetch"`

## Instructions

### 1. For each issue, evaluate:

**Clarity Score (1-5):**
- 5: Crystal clear, ready to implement
- 4: Minor clarification needed
- 3: Needs context or acceptance criteria
- 2: Vague, multiple interpretations possible
- 1: Unclear what is being asked

**What's missing? Think about what HASN'T been thought about:**
- Edge cases not considered?
- Dependencies on other issues?
- Technical constraints not mentioned?
- User impact not described?
- Testing strategy unclear?
- Rollback plan needed?

### 2. Skip issues that:
- Already have a "Triage Review" comment
- Already have label "ready"
- Were updated in the last 24 hours (let humans respond first)

### 3. For issues scoring 3 or below, add a comment:
```bash
gh issue comment NUMBER --body "## 🔍 Triage Review

**Clarity Score:** X/5

**Questions to Resolve:**
1. [Specific question]
2. [Another consideration]

**Suggested Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] [Testable criterion]

**Considerations:**
- [Edge case or constraint]

### 4. For issues scoring 4-5:
```bash
gh issue edit NUMBER --add-label "ready"
```

### 5. Guidelines:
- DO NOT add trivial comments or nitpicks
- DO NOT repeat what's already in the issue
- DO add substantive questions that reveal gaps
- THINK about what the implementer will discover that isn't documented

### 6. Project-specific context (if available):

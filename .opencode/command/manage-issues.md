Check for any open issues labeled 'help wanted' or 'bug'.
Before taking action, review ALL open issues to ensure the problem hasn't already been reported or fixed. Avoid creating duplicate issues.
If a relevant issue is found, pick the highest priority one and attempt to resolve it by creating a fix branch and PR.
If no issues are found, exit.
